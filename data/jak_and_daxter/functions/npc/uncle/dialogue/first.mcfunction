tellraw @a "Uncle: Well, hello there my dear boy. You've caught me at a most inopportune moment. I was to set off on my journeys yesterday, but I seem to be a spot short on the old Precursor orbs. I would've pledged my word that I had ninety of them. But I gather that your young friend, you know, the little annoying miserably ugly one, might have just pilfered them as a sort of a spot of fun.\n\nDaxter: (mockingly growls)\n\nUncle: Anyway, would you be kind enough to loan your dear old uncle ninety Precursor orbs, so he can get underway? I would offer you a power cell in return."
